    "# Reinforcement Learning (DQN) - Cartpole Task\n",
    "\n",
    "* The goal is for agent to learn keep the pole attached to a cart upright as long as possible. The agent does so by choosing between two actions: 'move the cart left or right'.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In reinforcement learning the agent learns how to act or take action by trail and error. In other words, by trying out and action and receving a feedback/reward. It uses the feedback/reward to learn if taking an action in a particular senario (state) was good or bad. The model aim to maximise the total accumulated reward. \n",
